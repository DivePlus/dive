DIVE project scripts 

This repo gathers a number of (Prolog, Python,...) scripts and commands for gathering, cleaning and moving data for the Dive project (http://diveproject.beeldengeluid.nl). It is a fork of https://github.com/biktorrr/dive which is 'frozen' for the original DIVE demonstrator. This repo is open for edits, specifically for the diveplus demonstrator (http://diveplus.beeldengeluid.nl)
